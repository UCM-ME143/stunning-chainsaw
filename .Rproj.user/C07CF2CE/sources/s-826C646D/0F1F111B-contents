# Root Locus

The root locus method shows how changes in one of the system parameters modifies the roots of the characteristic equation of a system.

This in turn, shows the changes in the dynamic response of the system.

In simple terms, if I increase the gain of a controller of a closed-loop system, how much will the damping ratio be effected - without having to explicitly find a solution.

Before the advent of software such as Matlab, root locus plots played a significant role in analysing system performance.  It is no longer critical to know how to draw a root locus plot, but it is still valuable to understand how to read and understand a root locus plot.

## Setting up a Root Locus
Most commonly, the root locus is used to study the effect of loop gain variation of a closed-loop system.

Given a transfer function of a closed-loop system
\begin{equation}
\frac{Y(s)}{R(s)}=\mathcal{T}(s) = \frac{D_c(s)G(s)}{1+D_c(s)G(s)}
\end{equation}

The characteristic function is given as 
\begin{equation}
0 = 1 + D_c(s)G(s)H(s)
\end{equation}

With careful consideration, this can be rewritten as 
\begin{equation}
0 = 1 + K\frac{b(s)}{a(s)} = 1 + KL(s)
\end{equation}
or, even better, as
\begin{equation}
a(s) + Kb(s) = 0
\end{equation}

As we already know, the characteristic equation sets the placement of the poles of the system
\begin{equation}
a(s) + Kb(s) = 0
\end{equation}

As we change K, we can change the locations of the poles, and thus design a system to our desired dynamics.

For example, given a plant and a K controller
\begin{equation}
G = \frac{1}{s^2+2s+3}
\end{equation}
The closed loop equation is given as
\begin{equation}
T(s) = \frac{K}{s^2+6s+3+K}
\end{equation}
The characteristic equation is given as 
\begin{equation}
0 = s^2 + 6s + 3 + K
\end{equation}

Using the quadractic formula, we can solve for the poles of this system
\begin{equation}
p = -1 \pm \frac{\sqrt{36-4\left(3+K\right)}}{2}
\end{equation}

When $K=0$, the poles of the system become $p = -1 \pm \frac{5}{2}$.  At $K = 6$, the poles of the system become $p = -3$.  Above $K>6$, the poles of the system diverge along the imaginary axis at $-3$ on the real axis.

The graph of all possible roots of the characteristic equation relative to parameter K is called the root locus and the methods to construct a graph is known as the root locus method of Evans.

## Properties
The root locus is the set of values of $s$ for which $1+KL(s) = 0$ is satisfied as the real parameter K varies from 0 to $+\infty$. Typically, $1+KL(s)=0$ is the characteristic equation of the system and in this case, the roots of the locus are the closed-poles of that system.  In otherwords, we do not have to work with the closed-loop system to study the performance of the K controller.

Even more interesting, given $1 + KL = 0$ and assuming that K must be real and positive, then $L$ must be real and negative such that $L=-\frac{1}{K}$.

Of note, the phase of a real, negative system must equal $180^\circ$.  

```{definition, name="Root Locus"}
The root locus of $L(s)$ is the set of points in the s-plane where the phase of $L(s) = 180^\circ$.  We can test whether a point in the s-plane is on the locus by defining the angle to the test point from a zero as $psi_i$ and the angle to the test point from a pole as $\phi_i$.  The summation of all the angles of the zeros minus the summation of all the angles of the poles must be $180^\circ$.  
\begin{equation}
\sum\psi_i - \sum\phi_i = 180^\circ + 360^\circ \left(l-1\right)
\end{equation}
where $l$ is some integer.
